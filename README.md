# IS 120 Project 1 - James Day

This is the first part of my class project for IS 120.

## Brief Description

This is a portfolio website for myself. As you can see, this is pretty bare bones right now. You probably also noticed that there is a bunch of latin placeholder nonsense in each of the descriptions. This was for a few reasons, the main one being that I don't have a lot of skills to describe yet. I also don't have a professional-looking profile photo yet, hence the picture of Evil James the cat instead.

Despite all the silliness on this website, I really do look forward to polishing it up and using it as a cool way to show off my skills to people. I'd like to get into entrepreneurship (hence that skill being listed), and this website would be a great way to get people interested in me and my skills, and also to network with people. Hopefully.

## Things I Learned

I learned how to do two new things during this project that were particularly notable. The first was applying a gradient mask to an element to get it to fade a certain way. I first did this with the `header`, and then liked how it looked so much that I added it to the `footer` and one other element on the home page as well. This is also how I got a square image of Evil James to become a circle, instead. I am very pleased with it and will likely sprinkle in the linear and radial gradients as much as I reasonably can.

The other thing I learned was how to make said gradients into a background color, as opposed to being applied to the whole element and all it's children. At first, I applied the gradient directly to the `header` element, but it make the navigation buttons start to fade into transparency, as well, which is not what I wanted. So I used AI to learn (**_NOT_** to write code), and figured out that I could make a `::before` element that was nested inside the parent element that I wanted to have the gradient background and apply it to that one instead. It took a little tinkering to figure out how to get it to render well, but, once again, I am very pleased with the result.

Also I learned that I have to `git add` all the files I modified before I do a `git commit`?? I don't remember having to do that before, but I could just be doing things wrong. Skill issue, I guess.

## Problems

One of the biggest changes I had to make to my website was the home page, specifically the little list of skills next to the pic of Evil James. Originally, I wanted to do the cool little rotating text thing that you have on your portfolio website, so I looked up examples of how to do it. I started to organize my stuff and try to get the animation timing right, but I just couldn't get it to look how I wanted. Usually the next bit of text started to appear before the current one could start to leave. Honestly, though, I think that the reason I couldn't get it to work is that I didn't spend enough time to learn and understand how keyframes and animations work in CSS. Had I more time, I think that would have been a really neat addition to my website.

## Design Decisions

For my website, I took a little bit of inspiration from your site, but modified it a little to be more simple. Had I used my time better, there probably would have been a bit more complexity in the layout. However, I like the way I laid everything out, and I like the look of a clean, simple design.

The reason I chose "Skills" and "About Me" as the other two pages is because so far in my career, I don't have much else to include. Again, as I go work and get more experience under my belt, I would love to polish up this website and make it actually useful.
